These processes are regulated in real-time by a network of sensors (mostly transcription factors) which monitor organismal physicochemical parameters and constantly trigger genomic responses aiming to restore optimal (evolutionary set) values and normal cellular functionality. At the whole organism level, these responses require complex co-regulation and wiring of cell-autonomous and non-autonomous mechanisms; which however, decline during aging leading to increased morbidity and mortality. The network of cellular sensors comprises numerous short-lived proteins, including nuclear factor erythroid 2 like 2 (NFE2L2/Nrf2) which reportedly modulates cell responses against (among others) oxidative/xenobiotic and proteome damage. We will discuss short- and long-term effects of Nrf2 activation and also our findings showing that persistent stress signaling via sustained Nrf2 activation triggers an adaptive metabolic response which reallocates resources from growth and longevity to somatic preservation and stress tolerance. Moreover, our efforts to therapeutically target the Nrf2 pathway for anti-aging purposes, including a detailed understanding of the correct time- (when), dose- (how much) or tissue- (where) targeted interventions will be presented.</p><p><br></p></div>

                    <p><strong> Ioannis Trougakos</strong> obtained his Ph.D. in Cellular-Developmental Biology from the University of Athens (UoA), Greece. He has worked as Research Scientist at the European Molecular Biology Laboratory, Germany; at the Centro De Biologia Molecular “Severo Ochoa”, Spain and at the National Hellenic Research Foundation, Athens, Greece; he was also research visitor at the Netherlands Cancer Institute. Currently he serves as Professor and Director of the “Cell Biology” lab at the Faculty of Biology, UoA; he directs three MSc UoA courses, he is vice Chairman of the Faculty of Nutrition and Dietetics, UoA, a member of the Coordination Board of the UoA Centre of Excellence on “Bioactive Natural Products” and also adjunct Professor of “Systems Biology of Ageing and Cancer”, at the European University Cyprus, Cyprus. Prof. Trougakos has received fellowships from the EU and the Hellenic State; has participated in many international courses, has been honored with various awards and he was an invited lecturer in international conferences and Universities; he was also invited Reviewer for the 2019 World Cancer Report. His scientific-research interests are focused on the understanding of the molecular-cellular basis of ageing and age-related diseases. He has published &gt;165 Publications/Chapters in Peer Reviewed International Scientific Journals or Books. His group is funded by National and International grants, by foundations, as well as by contractual activities with the industry.  </p>
