Loureiro, Maria do Carmo Pereira</p><p><br></p><p>LEPABE - Laboratory for Process Engineering, Environment, Biotechnology and Energy, Faculty of Engineering, University of Porto, Porto, Portugal</p><p><strong>Email: </strong>mcsp@fe.up.pt; jasl@fe.up.pt</p><p><strong><br></strong></p><p>Alzheimer´s Disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia with high impact worldwide, accounting for more than 46 million cases. Until now there is no cure for AD. Moreover, growing life expectancy will lead to an increase in numbers: to 75 million by 2030, 81.1 million by 2040 and 132 million in 2050 all over the world.</p><p>Most of the AD treatments shows limitations mainly related with its low bioavailability, requiring high administration doses of oral administration, to reach the brain at sufficient concentrations. The use of drug delivery systems (DDSs) based on nanoparticles (NPs) could be the ideal solution to overcome these issues. NP based DDSs can protect the molecules from degradation, transport them as “Trojan horses” and improve biodistribution, without modifying the therapeutic activity. NP-DDSs have several beneficial properties, such as biodegradability, biocompatibility, nontoxicity, non-immunogenicity, high stability in body fluids, and the ability to interact with specific receptors. In addition, the NPs allow a controlled and sustained drug release, facilitating the maintenance of therapeutically active doses for prolonged periods. Besides, drug encapsulation into nanocarriers reduces the required doses to produce the expected therapeutic effects due to an increased concentration at the site of action. In the last years, our team developed different types of DDS, such as liposomes, polymeric poly(lactic-co-glycolic) acid (PLGA) NPs and lipid nanoparticles, to encapsulate therapeutic molecules.&nbsp;</p><p>Transcytosis mediated NPs transportation by specific receptors is the most relevant mechanism to transport drugs across the blood-brain barrier (BBB). The conjugation of specific ligands on the NPs’ surface can improve their transfer. The appropriate selection of the ligand is crucial to increase the transport efficiency of NPs since the receptor needs to be overexpressed at the target site. That way, our group has a know-how to modulate the NPs surface to improve their uptake in the desired tissues.</p><p><br></p></div>
