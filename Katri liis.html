Our results demonstrate that hypothermia at least partly mitigates the dangers posed by reductive equivalents. During ischemic stroke, for example, ATP synthesis is inhibited. The most well known therapeutic mechanism of hypothermia is the preservation of ATP. In line with these observations, we found that hypoxia reduces ATP/ADP ratio at 37°C while mild hypothermia (32°C) increases ATP/ADP ratio in both normoxic and hypoxic cells. Another mechanism for mitigating the dangers posed by excess reducing equivalents is the channeling of acetyl-CoA into lipid droplets, which are chemically more stable depos of reductive power. As expected, lipid content was increased by hypoxia. However, mild hypothermia prevented hypoxia-dependent increase in lipid content. Furthermore, hypoxia-dependent increase in PPARg gene expression (fatty acid uptake) was abolished by hypothermia. Another mechanism to counteract the build­up of reducing equivalents is the antioxidant system that seeks to neutralize reactive oxygen species. In a recent study our group has demonstrated for the first time that mild hypothermia activates  Nrf2, a major regulator of antioxidant gene transcription, in normoxic cells and provides protection from oxidative stress presumably by orchestrating adaptive responses to redox stress.</p><p>Numerous studies suggest that reduced blood flow and oxygen deprivation result in the decoupling of citric acid cycle (CAC) and electron transport chain (ETC) as evidenced by ischemia ­reperfusion injury. We have recently developed a unique cellular respiration monitoring system to determine O2 and CO2 fluxes in intact cells in real time. It allows us to measure the production (by CAC) and utilization (by ETC) of reducing power. Mild hypothermia reduced O2 and CO2 fluxes approximately 25%. In addition, hypothermia introduced during anoxia enhanced the recovery of respiration.</p><p>This study addresses an important question on why hypothermia is effective in reducing hypoxic tissue damage. It suggests that hypothermia alleviates reductive stress, a conceptually novel and largely overlooked phenomenon at the root of ischemia reperfusion injury.</p></div>
