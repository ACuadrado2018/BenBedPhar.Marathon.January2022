Oxidative stress, inflammation and apoptosis driven by enhanced fat accumulation are critical mechanisms involved in the progression from NAFLD to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Even though, it is of utmost interest to understand the precise regulatory mechanisms of lipid accumulation in the human liver, underlying mechanisms leading to the transition from NAFLD to NASH are not fully understood. Against oxidative stress and inflammation, Nrf2 signaling involves in the regulation of a number of genes, including enzymes and cytoprotective proteins.&nbsp;</p><p>In our hypercholesterolemic rabbit model, high cholesterol diet induced 4-hydroxy-2,3-nonenal (HNE), 7-ketocholesterol (7KC) and Nrf2 levels along with other inflammation and apoptosis parameters, which involve in NASH progression. This is also consistent with our previous reports demonstrating that high cholesterol diet mediated HNE and Nrf2 induction in atherosclerosis development. Alpha-tocopherol, the most active form of vitamin E, is an important modulator of signaling mechanisms, but its involvement to cholesterol-mediated Nrf2 induction remains poorly defined. We showed that α-tocopherol supplementation reduced only protein levels of Nrf2 without affecting mRNA in hypercholesterolemic animals. Although α-tocopherol supplementation caused significant reduction of HNE, 7KC and Nrf2, lipid accumulation was not changed. These findings lead us to conclude that the steatosis-related beneficial effect of α-tocopherol in liver tissue is rather limited.</p><p><strong><br></strong></p><p><br></p></div>

                    <p><strong>Nesrin Kartal Ozer</strong> is Professor at Marmara University, Faculty of Medicine, Department of Biochemistry, Istanbul,Turkey. She graduated with a BSc in Pharmacy from Hacettepe University, Ankara, Turkey and she has received her PhD in Biochemistry in Hacettepe University, Faculty of Medicine. She moved then to Marmara University, Istanbul. She was a Visiting Scientist at St.George’s Hospital, Medical School, Department of Biochemistry, London, UK (1985-1986); Institute of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Bern, Switzerland (1993-2004) and University of Hohenheim, Stuttgart, Germany (2008). <br>In her research she published ~ 100 articles and she was invited speaker at ~80 international meetings. She was the organizer ~10 scientific meetings and conferences. <br>As member of International Organizations, it is worth mentioning her membership in the International Advisory Committee, Oxygen Club of California (1999- today); FEBS Advanced Course Committee Member (2003-2006); FEBS Fellowships Committee Member (2021-2024), Secretary General Society for Free Radical Research-Europe (SFRR-E) and Member of the Council (2003-2009) and President of SFRR-E (2013-2014). <br>She was awarded The Oxygen Club of California Award and “Life Time Honorary Member” in 2006 “In recognition of outstanding research contributions on the role of vitamin E in atherosclerosis and to fostering the field of free radical biology” and The Society for Free Radical Research-Europe Lifetime Achievement Award in 2019 “In recognition of Lifetime Extraordinary Scientific Achievements in the Field of Free Radical Research”. <br>Her research focus on endoplasmic reticulum stress, redox signaling and cell death in metabolism related diseases such as cardiovascular diseases and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. In parallel she has carried out research on the molecular function of tocopherols in these diseases.<br></p>
