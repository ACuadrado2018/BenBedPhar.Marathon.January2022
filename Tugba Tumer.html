The studies for the bioproperties of SLs as phytohormones date back to the 2010s, thereby; the number of investigations evaluating the potential biomedical promises of SLs in mammalian is limited. It is well established that phytohormones not only govern important physiological traits in plants but also have impacts on human physiological and pathological processes such as cell division, glucose metabolism and inflammation. In fact, uncontrolled and persistent systemic inflammation may develop into a chronic state that finally becomes unifying seed for the pathogenesis of various noncommunicable diseases such as neurodegenerative disorders, insulin resistance and even cancer. Our team has identified interactions of SLs with several signaling molecules and enzymes involved in inflammation, glucose metabolism, and cytoprotection within mammalian systems by using both in vitro and in silico analysis. In these studies, we showed that a representative SL analog, GR24 induced the expression of phase II detoxifying enzymes by activating Nrf2 in hepatic and macrophage cells under normal and inflammatory conditions. Nrf2 silencing and in silico molecular docking (against 16-mer peptide binding site on Keap1) studies suggested that GR24 may exert its anti-inflammatory activity by interfering with Keap1 and Nrf2 binding. Very recently, we have also showed that SLs have the potential for transcriptional regulation of Nrf2 mediated antioxidant pathway in brain microglia and endothelial cells of cerebral micro vessels. In this presentation, in addition to above-mentioned findings, we would like to discuss our current data demonstrating SL analogs with different bioactiphores can be multi-potent glia-and neuroprotective agents and in addition to Nrf2-Keap1 pathway they can be considerably effective against several neuroinflammation-related signaling cascades such as BDNF-TrkB and NLRP3. Therefore, SLs may provide novel multipotent therapeutically active skeleton on which in silico optimized SL-like pharmacophores can be developed and synthesized against inflammation related noncommunicable diseases for further preclinical and clinical investigations.</p><p><br></p></div>

                    <p><strong> Tugba Boyunegmez Tumer </strong>is Full Professor of Biochemistry at the Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics, Ã‡anakkale Onsekiz Mart University, Turkey. Her research team has mainly focused on understanding the molecular effects of natural product-derived and synthetic small molecules on chronic inflammatory diseases and associated degenerative conditions, particularly, cancer and neuroinflammation. Her lab combines in vitro/in vivo assays, multi-omic tools and in silico computation, modelling and ADMET approaches for rational lead discoveries.  Working on the interface of molecular pharmacology, molecular biology, and biochemistry, NRF2-KEAP1 signaling pathway stands at the center of her studies. She has been working on Strigolactones (SLs) and their potential health benefits in chronic inflammatory diseases since 2016 in the scope of EUROCAROTEN Cost action. Besides, she has moved her interest in design and synthesis of H2S releasing compounds including novel isothiocyanate derivatives as NRF2 activators. Prof. Tumer is the leader of several national projects with international collaborators, and she is working group member of Cost Actions CA15136 and CA20121.   </p>
